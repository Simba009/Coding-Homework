1. Can you explain the difference between stacks and queues? 
Stacks are LIFO and queues are FIFO. LIFO is last in first out and fifo is first in last out.
2. Create an empty queue.
from queue import Queue as SimpleQueue

q_empty = SimpleQueue()


3. Create an empty stack.

p = deque([])


4. In your empty queue, push four elements in this order: Blue, Red, Yellow, Green
q_empty.put('Blue')
q_empty.put('Red')
q_empty.put('Yellow')
q_empty.put('Green')

5. In your empty stack, push four elements in this order: Blue, Red, Yellow, Green

p.append('Blue')
p.append('red')
p.append('yellow)
p.append('green')

6. Pop two elements from your queue.
q_empty.get()
q_empty.get()

7. Pop two elements from your stack.
p.pop()
p.pop()

8. What elements are remaining in your queue? How about in your stack? Can you explain the difference?
queue is remaining yellow and green because it is fifo and for the stack it is blue and red because it is lifo.
