website = {
    'url': "https://www.reddit.com/",
    'name': "Reddit",
    'descr': "the front page of the internet",
    'year_founded': 2005,
    'num_users': 430000000,
}

2. You decide to rename your website and migrate to a new URL. Update your website with the new details.
# TODO: fill in the new details
new_details = {
    'name': "Bookface",
    'url': "https://the-cs.org/",
}
website.update(new_details)
# TODO: update your website

3. Write a line of code that does each of the following:
a. A safe method that prints the value in your website where the key is 'url', if it exists
website.get('url')
b. A safe method to get the value of 2005 in your website
website.get(2005)
4. Challenge question (OPTIONAL): In our last lesson you asked if there was a way to print a value from a dictionary if we know the value but not the key. For example, in our sample_dict from last homework:
sample_dict = {
  0:"zero",
  "1":"one",
  2:"two",
  "three":"three"
}
sample_dict[1] = "still one" 
sample_dict[2] = "still two"
sample_dict[3] = "still three"

We did the following to print the value "one":
Use a safe method (no error) to get the value "one" from sample_dict.
print(sample_dict.get("1"))

How do we print the value "one" without manually putting the key "1" in our code?
Here's a hint, we can use for loops to loop through dictionaries! Run the following lines of code and observe what the console prints out:
for k, v in sample_dict.items():
    print(k,v)

Can you change the above lines of code to print the key and value only if your value is "one"? HINT: try putting an if statement
