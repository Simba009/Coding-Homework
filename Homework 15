1. Concatenate the following tuple nums with another tuple.
nums = tuple(range(5))
print(nums + n)
n = tuple(range(5,7))
2. What is an item assignment? 

An item assignment is when you use = to assign a value to a variable

3. Add one line of code below that concatenates and does an item assignment for the tuple sequence
sequence = ('a', 'b', 'c')
print(sequence + n)

4. How many elements are in the following list?
list = ['a' , ('b',), 'c', ['d'], 'e', ('f,')]
4 elements

5. In the list from question 4, write a for loop that prints the type for each element in the list.
HINT: loop by index

for n in range(len(list))
  print(n[list])
