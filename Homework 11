1) Given a list of numbers nums, print a sorted copy of the list in ascending order and another copy in descending order. Then, print the list in its original order.

nums = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4]
print(sorted(nums))

2) Write two different ways to replace the list nums with a new list that is the list nums sorted ascending

# First way
nums = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4]
# Your code here 
nums = Sorted(nums)

print(nums) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]



# Second way
nums = [2, 3, 5, 1, 4]
# Your code here
nums = nums.sorted

print(nums) # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
