1. Are dictionaries ordered or unordered? Why?
Dictionaries are ordered because they are the same as when they are inputed. 

2. Create a function to add items to a dictionary. Create a new dictionary called prices and use the function you created to add these values (or any values you want) in your prices dictionary:

prices = {
   "banana": 4,
   "apple": 2,
   "orange": 1.5,
   "pear": 3
}

def add_pricess(x,y,z): 
  x[y] = x.get(y, 0) + z

pricess = {} 
add_pricess(pricess, 'banana', 1)
add_pricess(pricess, 'apple', 10)
add_pricess(pricess, 'orange', 100)
add_pricess(pricess, 'pear', 1000)
print(pricess)


3. Loop through the prices dictionary. Compute and print the total price and the average price of all the fruits. 
t = 0
for i in pricess.values():
  t = t + i
print('the total is', t)
print('the avarage is', t/len(pricess))
