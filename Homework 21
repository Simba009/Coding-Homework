2. What does it mean if two sets are disjoint? Create two sets that are disjoint and test that they are disjoint in two different ways.
two sets are disjoint if they have all different elements in the sets. 
s = {0,1,2,3,4}
s2 = {6,7,8,9}
print(s.isdisjoint(s2))

3. What is a subset? Create two sets, one of which is a subset of the other set. Test that your set is a subset in two different ways.
A subset of one thing is when one set is containg all the elements of another set and is equal to that set

s = {0, 1}
other = {0,1,2}

print(s.issubset (other))
print(s < (other))

4. What is a proper subset? Is your set from question 3 a proper subset? Create three sets: set_a, set_b, and set_c, where set_a is a subset of set_b and a subset of set_c, but is a proper subset only of set_c.
A proper subset is when one set has more items than another set and the other set is in the first set
set_a = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}
set_b = {3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0}
set_c = {3,4,5,6}
