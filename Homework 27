sample_dict = {
  0:"zero",
  "1":"one",
  2:"two",
  "three":"three"
}

1. Describe sample_dict. Sample dict is a dctionary that has 4 elements. The first elemtent is key 0 and the value of that key is "zero"
The second element is the key "1" and the value is "one"
The third element is the key 2 and the value is "two"
The fourth element is the key "three" and the value is also "three"

2. Does each line of code below add or update an element in sample_dict? How do you know?
sample_dict[0] = "still zero"
sample_dict[1] = "still one"
sample_dict[2] = "still two"
sample_dict[3] = "still three"
It does because it is different from the perivious ones and it adds still to it. 

Run the above lines of code for questions 3-5.
3. Use a safe method (no error) to get the value "one" from sample_dict. sample_dict.get("one")
4. Use a safe method (no error) to find the value from sample_dict with a key 2.sample_dict.get(2)
5. Use a safe method (no error) to find the value from sample_dict with a key 5.sample_dict.get(5)
