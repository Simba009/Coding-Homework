1. What is an object in Python? What are some examples of objects?
string
tuple
set
list
integer
ect...
2. What is the difference between .discard() and .remove() ?
discard if there is no object it wont give you a error but for .remove it will

3. Use the set s to answer the following questions:
s = {'q', 'r', 's', 't'}
b = {}
Remove 'q' from the set using the safe remove function
s.discard('q')
Remove 'v' from the set using the safe remove function
s.discard('v')
Print (s)
Remove the rest of the remaining elements at once
s.clear()
Check that s is equivalent to the empty set
print(s == b )
4. Create a set called half_alphabet_set using the string half_alphabet_string
half_alphabet_set = {abcdefghijklm}
5. Create a string of your favorite word that is at least 5 letters.
f = 'money'
6. Write a for loop that prints whether each letter in your word is in the set you created in question 4.
for f in range:
  b = 0
  b = b + 1
  print(f in half_alphabet_set[b])
