# Describe the following line of code. Write a few sentences that tell me about what the following line of code does.
example_object = ([1,2,3],[4,[5],{6,7}],{8,9,(10,(11,12)),(13,14)})
the following code is making an tuple. This tuple has 3 elements. The first element in the tuple is a list. It contains 3 integers: 1,2, and 3. 
The next element is another list which contains one integer, 4 and a list that cointains one integer,5.Then there is a set which contains two intgers, 6 and 7.
Then the last element is a set which contains 2 integers 8 and 9 and contains 2 tuples, the first tuple contains 10 and another tuple, that tuple contains 2 intgers, 11 and 12. Then the last tuple contains 13 and 14.
