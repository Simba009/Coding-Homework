Given the list big_pop_parks of tuples containing the park name, state, and visits per year (in millions) of the 6 most visited national parks in the United States, unpack each tuple using a for loop.
big_pop_parks = [
    ("Great Smoky Mountains National Park", 'NC/TN', 12.5),
    ("Grand Canyon National Park", 'AZ', 5.97),
    ("Rocky Mountain National Park", 'CO', 4.7),
    ("Zion National Park", 'UT', 4.5),
    ("Yosemite National Park", 'CA', 4.4),
    ("Yellowstone National Park", 'ID/MT/WY', 4),
]


for item in enumerate(big_pop_parks):
  o , l = item
  print('The place', l,'has', o, 'million visitors per year')

Write a function divr that returns the quotient and remainder of two arguments x, y. (That is, the result of floor division and modulo.) Your result will be a tuple where the first element is the quotient and the second element is the remainder

""" Starter Code"""
def divr(x, y):
    print(x // y )
    print(x % y )

print(divr(8, 2))
print(divr(7, 3))
print(divr(-3,4))
