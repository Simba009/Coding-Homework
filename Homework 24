# 4. (40 points) You and a friend are packing for a picnic. You've separately been packing your picnic baskets when you realize that you're bringing too much food.
# Let's check to see which duplicate items that you and your friend may have both packed.

# What set operation can we use to figure out which items are duplicated in both your picnic basket and your friend's picnic basket? Create a set duplicates by using this set operation on both of the picnic baskets.
# Once you have the set of duplicates, use a for loop to go through and remove each item from one of the picnic baskets. (This way, only one of you is carrying the item.)
# Can you remove the items in such a way that you and your friend are carrying the same number of items?
# Hint: What function do we use to figure out the size of a set? Can you write an if statement that checks which picnic basket has more items and remove the item from that picnic basket?


# The code below is to help you get started:

your_basket = {
    "apples",
    "crackers",
    "bread",
    "carrots",
    "peanut butter",
    "lettuce",
    "tomato",
    "turkey",
    "juice"
}

friends_basket = {
    "bread",
    "apples",
    "grapes",
    "cheese",
    "ketchup",
    "mustard",
    "water",
    "crackers"
}

# create a set duplicates that has the items that are in both baskets
duplicates = {'crackers'}
duplicates1 = {'apple', 'bread'}
print("These are the duplicate items:",duplicates,duplicates1)

# print the set duplicates
for i in duplicates:
  if i in friends_basket:
    friends_basket.remove(i) 

for i in duplicates1:
  if i in your_basket:
    your_basket.remove(i) 
print(your_basket)
print(friends_basket)
print(your_basket)
