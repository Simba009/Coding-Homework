1. What is a stack? What are the functions that we can use on stacks, and what does each one do?
A stack is a list but it is stacked up from top to bottom, it is a deque

2. Create two nonidentical deques of your choosing. Then, using the pop() and append() functions, make it so that your deques are identical. Use the print function to show this.
nums = deque([1,2,3,4,5,6,7])
nums2 = deque([1,2,3,4,5])
nums2.append(6)
nums.pop

3. Review of tuples: Given the following starter code, use slicing and other tuple operations to do the following tasks on `num_tup`:

a.  Print what range is between the first and last elements of the tuple. Ex. `The range is from 4 to 10`
b.  Print a tuple comprised of `num_tup` repeated three times.


"""Starter Code"""

num_tup = (4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 45, 50, 84)

print('The range is from',num_tup[1],'to',num_tup[-1])
num_tup3 = (num_tup, num_tup, numtup)
print(num_tup3)
